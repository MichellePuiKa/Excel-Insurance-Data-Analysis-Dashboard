- **Adjust Premium Pricing for High-Risk Segments:** The 35-44 age group in urban areas shows the highest claim frequency, suggesting a need for risk-based pricing adjustments.
- **Strengthen Referral Programs:** With referrals contributing only 10%, incentives can be improved to increase customer acquisition through word-of-mouth.
- **Implement Risk Mitigation Strategies:** For urban policyholders, promoting safer driving initiatives or telematics-based insurance could help manage claim risks.
